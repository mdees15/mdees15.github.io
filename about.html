    <h1 class="am-title">Hi, Iâ€™m Mitchell!</h1>

    <p class="am-content">I am a recent computer science graduate looking for a place to start my career in the industry.
         In the fall of 2022 I graduated from Colorado State University with a bachelors
          in computer science with a concentration of software engineering. The areas of the field that I enjoyed the most
           and focused on during university are software engineering, database management, and cybersecurity. In particular, cybersecurity
            really caught my eye in the last two semesters of my time at Colorado State. After getting myself settled into the
             industry a bit more, I plan on completing a masters degree focused on cybersecurity. I am currently looking
              for an entry level position to get my career started. If you think I could be a good fit for your organization, head over
               to the contact page to reach me on LinkedIn!</p>
