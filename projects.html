            <h2>Chess Web App</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>In CS414: Object-Oriented Design my team and I were tasked with designing, building, and deploying a chess web application.
                 Over the course of the project the team would meet before class started for scrum stand-ups and also met on Microsoft Teams
                  twice a week to have “virtual stand-ups” with our remote teammates. The design portion of the project involved creating user
                   stories, domain modeling based on the created user stories, creating a UML class diagram of our proposed solution, designing
                    an ER diagram for the app database, and creating a traceability link matrix. We used the Github projects tab to create tasks,
                     estimate time for task completion, assign tasks, and keep track of our progress using a kanban board. As for the app itself,
                      the front end was built using the React framework and the back was built with Java. The contributions I made to coding the
                       project were updating the SQL database based on the project needs, coding the logic for a couple of chess pieces such as the
                        knight, and interactions between the database and the backend of the web app using JDBC. The team used test driven development
                            for the whole project using Jest, JUnit, and Mockito.</p>

            <h2>Unity Video Game</h2>
            
            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>In CS462: Engaging in Virtual Worlds I was tasked with designing, modeling, animating, and coding a video game using
                 the Unity game engine and Blender. I created a simple stealth based game heavily inspired by games like Metal Gear
                  Solid and Assassins Creed. The goal of the game was to visit 4 different computer stations in a level and disarm
                   a bomb by solving a set of clues given by the computers. The interactions programmed into the world are basic player
                    movement such as running and jumping, attacking and destroying robot enemies, the robots field of view and movement
                     paths, and finally the player entering in the solved code at the end of the game. Everything in the game including
                      environment models, texturing, and other details was made by myself throughout the semester besides the sounds
                       used. I learned and applied the basics of 3d modeling, rigging, and animating using Blender. The programming
                        for the game was done in C# and ran in the Unity game engine.</p>

            <p>I created this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to serve as an expanded resume and portfolio for myself.
                 Another purpose of this website is to have fun messing around with the three tools listed above. Depending on
                  how busy I am I might add more functionality and simple games to the site as time goes on.</p>
